Description: Clears the workspace. Useful for the beginnings of R scripts, to
    avoid potential problems with accidentally using information from variables
    or functions from previous script evaluations, too many figure windows open
    at the same time, packages that you don't need any more, or a cluttered
    console.  Uses code from various StackOverflow users.  See help(mise) for
    pointers to the relevant StackOverflow pages.
